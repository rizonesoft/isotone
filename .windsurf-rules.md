# Windsurf Development Rules for Isotone CMS

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Read LLM Documentation First!

This project has comprehensive LLM-specific documentation. **You MUST read these files before making any changes:**

### Required Reading (in order):
1. 📖 **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** - Project overview and critical rules
2. 🤖 **[docs/LLM-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md](docs/LLM-DEVELOPMENT-GUIDE.md)** - Essential LLM development guide  
3. 📏 **[docs/AI-CODING-STANDARDS.md](docs/AI-CODING-STANDARDS.md)** - Coding standards for AI
4. 📚 **[docs/DOCUMENTATION-MAINTENANCE.md](docs/DOCUMENTATION-MAINTENANCE.md)** - Keep docs in sync

## 🚫 Absolute Rules (NEVER Break These)

1. **NO Node.js/npm** - This is a pure PHP project
2. **NO database migrations** - RedBeanPHP handles schema automatically
3. **NO complex build processes** - Must work on shared hosting
4. **NO Laravel/Symfony patterns** - This is lightweight, custom
5. **ALWAYS run `composer docs:check`** before completing any task

## ✅ Quick Checklist for Every Task

```bash
# 1. Before starting
composer docs:check

# 2. After making changes
composer docs:update
composer docs:check

# 3. Before claiming completion
composer test
composer check-style
composer docs:check  # MUST PASS!
```

## 🎯 Key Facts

- **PHP 8.3+** only, PSR-12 standards
- **XAMPP on Windows** - test at `http://localhost/isotone/`
- **RedBeanPHP ORM** - no migrations needed
- **WordPress-like hooks** - `add_action()` and `add_filter()`
- **Shared hosting compatible** - keep it simple

## 📁 Files to Update When Coding

| If you... | Update these files |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Add a route | `app/Core/Application.php`, `docs/getting-started.md` |
| Add env var | `.env.example`, document in setup guide |
| Add a file | `CLAUDE.md` file list |
| Add a feature | `README.md` status (🚧 → ✅) |
| Change API | All examples using that API |
